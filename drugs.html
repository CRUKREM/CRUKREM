			<p>Thanks for trying out the Cancer Research UK augmented reality activity! Every day our researchers work hard to solve difficult problems and save lives. <b>This is your chance to step into the shoes of a researcher and try to figure out a problem of your own.</b></p>

		<div id="2">
			<p><b>Cancer Research UK’s research has played a role in developing many of the world’s top 10 cancer drugs. </b>See if you can solve this puzzle and figure out how many of the world’s top 10 cancer drugs Cancer Research UK’s research has played a role in developing.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="3">
			<p><b>Aim your device at the black square with the white shape in the middle. </b>You can do this now, even with the instructions open. You should see a 3D model of a molecule called abiraterone, an important treatment for advanced prostate cancer. As with any molecule, abiraterone is made up of a very specific collection of atoms. You can see what each atom is by comparing its colour on the model to the corresponding colour on the legend below.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="4">
			<p>See if you can count the total number of carbon atoms that are bonded to exactly two other hydrogen atoms, or a combination of one hydrogen and one oxygen atom. The total number you get will be the answer to the following skill-testing question: <b>How many of the world’s top 10 cancer drugs has Cancer Research UK’s research played a role in developing?</b></p>

		<p>Try pointing your phone at some of those puzzle squares you printed and cut out. Pretty cool huh? Four of these squares can be arranged to make a 3D model of a plastic mask worn during radiotherapy. Think of it like a puzzle - see if you can put the mask pieces together the right way. The square with the numbers on it is important too. It shows you the different patterns your other squares might make once you've completed the mask. Compare the shape you've made with these shapes to figure out the answer to this question!
